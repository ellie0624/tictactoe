# tictactoe
This is one of my first personal projects using Python. This game still has a lot of limits because it only allows X to go first and I haven't figured out how to 
restart the game when asking the players to replay or not. I'm gonna upgrade it later :)).
I couldn't have finished this without the detailed tutorial from Aaron Bernath (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHh654_7Cmw&t=45s) 
and James Shah (https://medium.com/byte-tales/the-classic-tic-tac-toe-game-in-python-3-1427c68b8874).
